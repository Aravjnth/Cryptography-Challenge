# Cryptography Challenge

## Overview

The Cryptography Challenge project is a Python-based platform designed to host and manage cryptographic puzzles and challenges. This platform allows participants to engage in various cryptographic tasks, such as encryption, decryption, cipher analysis, and cryptographic protocol implementation, to test and enhance their cryptography skills.

## Features

- Hosts a collection of cryptographic challenges and puzzles.
- Provides challenges in encryption algorithms (e.g., AES, RSA), cipher analysis, steganography, and more.
- Supports multiple difficulty levels for beginners to advanced participants.
- Tracks participant progress and scores.
- Generates hints and solutions for challenges.
- User-friendly web interface for browsing challenges and submitting solutions.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- `flask` framework for web application development
- `cryptography` library for cryptographic operations
- `sqlalchemy` library for database management

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
